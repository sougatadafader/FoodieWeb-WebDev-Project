### Problem Statement:
There is a lack of open-source online platform that allows users to share recipes with their social community. Hand writing the recipes and ingredients is still the norm. However, sharing recipes with multiple other people from physical notebook can be a challenge. At the same time, preparing the list of ingredients based on the cookbook can also be troublesome as it will require multiple iterations, and a pen and paper. Online cookbook aims to have a solution that will make it easy to share recipes among a lot of people and search recipes based on multiple search criteria. It will also create a grocery list faster without the need for a notebook.

### Target Audience:
Our target audience would be people who either don't have a proper channel to learn, how to cook new dishes or do not have the patience to go through different blog posts or youtube videos which are rarely organized. 

### Solution Proposal:
* Online Cookbook will allow searching for recipes based on different search criteria e.g. ingredient, diet, allergy, nutrition and cuisine.
* Users will have the option to share recipes with their social community. Other people from the community can rate and review the recipes.
* Users can make a personalized grocery list from the list of ingredients of recipes with a single click. The grocery list will be editable and changes to it can be saved.
* Users will be able to add recipes to their favorite list. Each user will have their unique favorite list.
